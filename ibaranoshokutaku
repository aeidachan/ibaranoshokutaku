   "description":"Itoi is a young editor who has always avoided working on cookbooks, until he had no choice but to take over for his boss and work with the beautiful but sharp-tongued master chef, Kashima. Kashima soon figures out the reason why Itoi is uncomfortable with cooking… Meanwhile, Sudou is Itoi’s competent but twisted superior at work, and Natsume is a food photographer who avoids portraits. What starts as a hook up turns into an exciting love story, in the debut work of the up and coming Hasami Sahara!",
